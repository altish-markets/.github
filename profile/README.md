  <strong>Live shopping platform with RWA tokenization and Gachapon gamification on Solana blockchain</strong>
</div>

## About

Altworth is a next-generation live shopping platform that combines real-world asset (RWA) tokenization with engaging Gachapon-style gamification. Built on the Solana blockchain, the platform enables users to purchase tokenized assets through an interactive, game-like experience powered by Web3 technology.

### Core Focus Areas

- **Live Shopping**: Interactive shopping experience with real-time engagement
- **RWA Tokenization**: Real-world assets represented as NFTs on Solana
- **Gachapon Gamification**: Japanese capsule-toy inspired mechanics for an engaging purchase experience

## Architecture

Our platform is built with a microservices architecture:

- **[Frontend](https://github.com/altworth-markets/front-end)** - Next.js application with Web3 integration
  - **Live Demo**: [altworth.netlify.app](https://altworth.netlify.app)
  - Stack: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Solana Web3.js
  - Features: Wallet integration, Gachapon capsule purchase, NFT claiming, admin dashboard

- **[Backend](https://github.com/altworth-markets/backend)** - RESTful API server
  - Stack: Bun runtime, Hono framework, PostgreSQL
  - Features: Item/RWA management, capsule operations, buyback pricing, transaction tracking

- **[SDK](https://github.com/altworth-markets/sdk)** - TypeScript SDK for platform integration
  - Packages: `@altworth-markets/sdk-core`, `sdk-react`, `sdk-solana`, `sdk-types`
  - Published to: GitHub Packages
  - Features: Type-safe API client, React hooks, Solana utilities

- **[Contracts](https://github.com/altworth-markets/contracts)** - Solana smart contracts
  - Stack: Anchor framework, Rust
  - Features: NFT minting, Gachapon mechanics, marketplace operations

## Tech Stack

**Blockchain & Web3**
- Solana blockchain (devnet/mainnet)
- Anchor framework for smart contracts
- Solana Web3.js for client integration
- Helius RPC for reliable blockchain access

**Frontend**
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Wallet adapter for multi-wallet support

**Backend**
- Bun runtime for performance
- Hono web framework
- PostgreSQL database
- Drizzle ORM

**Infrastructure**
- Netlify for frontend hosting
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker for local development
- GitHub Packages for private SDK distribution

## How It Works

1. **Admin Setup**: Platform administrators add tokenized RWAs/NFTs and create Gachapon capsules
2. **User Experience**: Users connect their Web3 wallet and purchase Gachapon capsules using cryptocurrency
3. **Reveal & Claim**: Gamified reveal experience shows the tokenized assets, users can claim NFTs or sell back to platform
4. **Live Shopping**: Real-time, interactive shopping experience with blockchain transparency

## Security & Best Practices

- **API Key Protection**: Secure RPC proxy pattern keeps Helius API keys server-side
- **Authentication**: GitHub Packages for private SDK access
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with Jest
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across all repositories
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and automated CI checks
